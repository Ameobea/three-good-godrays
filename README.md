# `three-good-godrays`

[![CI](https://github.com/ameobea/three-good-godrays/actions/workflows/cd.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ameobea/three-good-godrays/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
[![Version](https://badgen.net/npm/v/three-good-godrays?color=green)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/three-good-godrays)

Good godrays effect for three.js using the [pmndrs `postprocessing` library](https://github.com/pmndrs/postprocessing)

Adapted from [original implementation](https://github.com/n8python/goodGodRays) by [@n8python](https://github.com/n8python)

**Demo**: <https://three-good-godrays.ameo.design>

## Install

`npm install three-good-godrays`

Or import from unpkg as a module:

```ts
import { GodraysPass } from 'https://unpkg.com/three-good-godrays@0.6.1/build/three-good-godrays.esm.js';
```

## Usage

```ts
import { EffectComposer, RenderPass } from 'postprocessing';
import * as THREE from 'three';
import { GodraysPass } from 'three-good-godrays';

const { scene, camera, renderer } = initYourScene();

// shadowmaps are needed for this effect
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;
renderer.shadowMap.type = THREE.PCFSoftShadowMap;
renderer.shadowMap.autoUpdate = true;

// Make sure to set applicable objects in your scene to cast + receive shadows
// so that this effect will work
scene.traverse(obj => {
  if (obj instanceof THREE.Mesh) {
    obj.castShadow = true;
    obj.receiveShadow = true;
  }
});

// godrays can be cast from either `PointLight`s or `DirectionalLight`s
const lightPos = new THREE.Vector3(0, 20, 0);
const pointLight = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 10000);
pointLight.castShadow = true;
pointLight.shadow.mapSize.width = 1024;
pointLight.shadow.mapSize.height = 1024;
pointLight.shadow.autoUpdate = true;
pointLight.shadow.camera.near = 0.1;
pointLight.shadow.camera.far = 1000;
pointLight.shadow.camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
pointLight.position.copy(lightPos);
scene.add(pointLight);

// set up rendering pipeline and add godrays pass at the end
const composer = new EffectComposer(renderer, { frameBufferType: THREE.HalfFloatType });

const renderPass = new RenderPass(scene, camera);
renderPass.renderToScreen = false;
composer.addPass(renderPass);

// Default values are shown.  You can supply a sparse object or `undefined`.
const params = {
  density: 1 / 128,
  maxDensity: 0.5,
  edgeStrength: 2,
  edgeRadius: 2,
  distanceAttenuation: 2,
  color: new THREE.Color(0xffffff),
  raymarchSteps: 60,
  blur: true,
  gammaCorrection: true,
};

const godraysPass = new GodraysPass(pointLight, camera, params);
// If this is the last pass in your pipeline, set `renderToScreen` to `true`
godraysPass.renderToScreen = true;
composer.addPass(godraysPass);

function animate() {
  requestAnimationFrame(animate);
  composer.render();
}
requestAnimationFrame(animate);
```

### Gamma Correction

Gamma correction is enabled by this effect by default, matching expectations of sRGB buffers from `postprocessing`. However, you can disable this by setting `gammaCorrection: false` in the configuration object for the pass.

This may be necessary if you use other effect passes after `GodraysPass` that perform their own output encoding. If you see artifacts similar to these:

![Screenshot of artifacts caused by double encoding in a Three.Js pmndrs postprocessing pipeline.  There is a grainy pattern of colorful pixels appearing over an otherwise blank black background.](https://i.ameo.link/bto.png)

Try setting `gammaCorrection: false` on the `GodraysPass` or setting `encodeOutput = false` on any `EffectPass` that is added after the `GodraysPass`.

## Develop + Run Demos Locally

- Clone repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run prepublishOnly` to run initial builds
- `npm install -g serve`
- Run `node esbuild.mjs` whenever files are chnaged to re-build
- Run `serve public/demo -p 5001` and visit http://localhost:5001 in your browser
